HyperStudio explores the potential of new media technologies for the enhancement of education and research in the humanities. Our work focuses on questions about the integration of technology into humanities curricula within the broader context of scholarly inquiry and pedagogical practice.

### Annotation Studio

Annotation Studio is a web-based application that engages students in interpreting literary texts and other humanities documents. Annotation Studio is a web application that helps students develop traditional humanistic skills including close reading, textual analysis, persuasive writing, and critical thinking.

Features included and under development: 
- easy-to-use annotation tools that facilitate linking and comparing primary texts with multi-media source, variation, and adaptation documents; 
- sharable collections of multimedia materials prepared by faculty and student users; 
- filtering and display mechanisms for texts, written annotations, and multimedia annotations; 
- tools for visualizing reader interactions with texts
- collaboration functionality; and 
- multimedia composition tools.

At present, no educational platform combines text and multimedia annotation tools with a user-friendly interface that engages students in reading, interpreting, and writing about seminal texts. Annotation Studio will make text analysis intuitive for students while integrating educational features such as participatory functionality and multimedia composition tools.

The proposed platform will have the capacity to engage learners in close reading and collaborative interpretation of classic humanities texts. Tapping the unique affordances of digital media and associated cultural practices, Annotation Studio will draw students into the traditional activities of humanistic scholarship: exploring sources and influences; examining historical and cultural contexts; tracing the flow of ideas across time, geography, and media; and considering multiple perspectives.
